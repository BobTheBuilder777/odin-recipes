<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This New York cheesecake is dense and rich. It includes a great technique for letting the cheesecake finish in the oven so that no cracks form as the cake cools. 
    It's a favorite dessert of mine served with my fresh strawberry sauce.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>For the crust:</b> graham cracker crumbs and melted butter</li>
    <li>
        <b>For the filling:</b> sour cream, all-purpose flour, vanilla extract, cream cheese, white sugar, milk, eggs, 
        lemon zest, and orange zest
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

    <li>Make the filling and pour it over the crust. </li>
