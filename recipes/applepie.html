<h2>Best Apples for Apple Pie</h2>
<p>
    This recipe calls for Granny Smith apples for a couple reasons: Their firmness means they will hold their shape during cooking and their tart flavor perfectly balances out the sweetness of the sugar. 
    Some bakers prefer using Granny Smith apples in combination with a slightly sweeter variety, such as Honeycrisp.

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Make the filling: On the stove, make a paste with flour and butter. Add the sugar and water and bring to a boil. Simmer, then remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Assemble the pie: Press one crust into a pie plate. Place the sliced apples on the bottom crust. Use the top crust to make a lattice crust according to the recipe below. Pour the butter-sugar mixture over the lattice crust.</li>
    <li>Bake the pie: Bake the pie in a preheated oven until the apples are soft and the crust is golden brown.</li>
